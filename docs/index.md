# Welcome to CBSD

<i>Are you tired of manually typing hundreds of commands just to organize a virtual system? May we recommend CBSD instead</i>


CBSD is a software project intended as a management layer for the FreeBSD Jail subsystem, written to utilize jail(8), bhyve and Xen. 
The project idea is to offer a single integrated tool for building and deploying virtual environments quickly, with pre-defined software sets and minimal configuration. The project doesn't alter the OS in any way, instead it offers automation and speeds up deployment.
